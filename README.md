# Hypertensive Retinopathy 

This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Xception Nets to detect hypertensive retinopathy from retinal images. Hypertensive retinopathy is a condition caused by high blood pressure, which can lead to damage in the blood vessels of the retina. Early detection of hypertensive retinopathy is crucial for timely intervention and prevention of vision loss. This model utilizes the powerful Xception architecture, which is known for its high performance in image recognition tasks. 

The dataset used for this project consists of retinal images labeled with hypertensive retinopathy and healthy retinas gathered from DRIVE, HRF, and CHASE DB1- STARE datasets. Enhancement of retinal fundus images was done using the IETK-Ret package, which stands for Image Enhancement Toolkit for Retinal Fundus Images and augmented to enhance the model's performance and generalization capabilities.
